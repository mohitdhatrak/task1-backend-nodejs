# Task 1 Backend NodeJS

Problem statement: You are given n words. Some words may repeat. For each word, find its number of occurrences.
The output should contain the number of occurrences of each distinct word. See the sample
input/output for clarification.

Input Format: The first line of the input is n. The next n lines each contain a word.

Output Format: On the first line, the output should be the number of distinct words from the
input. On the second line, print the number of occurrences for each distinct word according to
their appearance in the input.

Bonus:
(To be shown separately) Arrange each distinct word in the input according to their occurrences
in descending order. Also, print the most repeated word and the least repeated word.
